# Crystals Collector
Are you smarter than a second grader? Sum the values of the crystals to find out.

At the beginning of the game, a random number generated, and four crystals are visible on the page for the user to click. The value of each crystal is hidden until each click.

Each click adds a specific amount of points to the total Player Score.

The goal is to win the game by matching the Player Score to the number randomly generated at the beginning of the game. The game is lost if the score exceeds that of the random number. When new games start, these values are randomly changed, so don't worry, if you need to sharpen your mental math skills, you can play again!
